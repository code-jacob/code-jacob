## About me

I have a degree in Applied Mechanics, so I like to do calculations, simulations, optimizations or designs. I am a responsible and caring person who wants to understand what he is doing and is interested in how things work. In the recent few years, I've been a big fan of CAE open source software like code_aster and OpenFOAM.
