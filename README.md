## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**code-jacob/code-jacob** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I have a degree in Applied Mechanics, so I like to do calculations, simulations, optimizations or designs. I am a responsible and caring person who wants to understand what he is doing and is interested in how things work. In the recent few years, I've been a big fan of CAE open source software like code_aster and OpenFOAM.
