## About me

I have a degree in Applied Mechanics, so I like to do calculations, simulations, optimizations or designs. I am a responsible and caring person who wants to understand what he is doing and is interested in how things work. In the recent few years I've become a big fan of open source CAE software such as code_aster and OpenFOAM.
